# elec1601 project
This is a project done for course ELEC1601 at the University of Sydney. 
The final code can be find in code_documentation, one for the master unit 
(PJ_MASTER_V2.0) and one for the slave unit (PJ_SLAVE_V2.0)

# Ideas
Our idea is to build a self-navigating robot that automatically avoids 
obsticalas well as detecting the temperature changes in the surrounding,
When temperature changes been detected, the robot will alert the master 
unit via bluetooth communication by changing the master units LED light.

# Note
Requires a remote controller to work, switch mode with button 1 (auto) 0 (manual).
