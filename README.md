# ELEC1601 project
This is a project done for subject ELEC1601 at the University of Sydney.  
The final code can be found in code_documentation, one for the master unit   
(PJ_MASTER_V2.0) and one for the slave unit (PJ_SLAVE_V2.0)  

# Ideas
Our idea is to build a self-navigating robot that automatically avoids  
obstacles well as detects the temperature changes in the surrounding.  
When temperature changes are detected, the robot will alert the master  
unit via Bluetooth communication by changing the master unit's LED light.  
 

# Note
Requires a remote controller to work, switch between modes with button 1 (auto) 0 (manual). 
* If your servo doesn't start/move
    - Make sure the battery is fully charged, the servo motor draws a lot of power when starting up
    - Other solutions can be found on
